### Strategy

The goal of this site is to provide clear, easy to access information on safeguarding, including how to recognise and respond to any safeguarding concerns. The layout and navigation should be simple and intuitive, making the information easy to access and understand.

### Scope

I used a github project board with user stories to track progress and ensure the requirements were met within the time frame. I used ChatGPT AI create the user stories from specific prompts then refined them.

 My must-have user stories amounted to an MVP, with should- and could-haves adding extra value.

**Must-have user stories focused on 5 main areas as outlined in the brief:**
- Simple and easy to understand information on safeguarding and it's key principles
- Information on how to recognise and respond to safeguarding concerns
- Accessibilty 
- Easy to use Navigation and Layout
- Responsivity for mobile, tablet, and desktop

**Should-have stories allowed users to find more information than found on the website:**
- Further information/links to other sites related to safeguarding

**Could-have stories focussed on encouraging users to report if they had concerns :**
- Contact form to allow users to report their concerns directly
- Testimonials to reassure users that reporting was the right thing to do

### Structure

The structure of this site is quite simple, with it being one page.

There is a naviagtion bar fixed at the top so it is easily accessed from everywhere on the site. The links take you to different sections of the site. 

On the navigation bar and in the hero section of the page there is a button with "Report a Concern". This takes you to the contact section of the site within the footer, so users can easily find the contact information needed to report a safeguarding concern. 

There is also a link within the last card of the Respond to Concerns section which takes you to the same place. It is assumed that a user with a concern may want read through the sections above before reporting, and once they have, this link will take them to the next step. 

### Skeleton

Balsamiq Wireframes were used to plan the layout of the site.

### Surface 
 
My design choices are outlined below. 

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen to be calming and professional, whilst meeting accessibility guidelines for colour contrast. A pale blue fading to teal is used for the background whilst a darker blue is used for the text, navigation and footer. Within the "Respond to Concerns" cards the colour combination is flipped for emphasis, with a dark blue background and pale blue text.  When necessary for accessibilty and colour contract, black or white text is used. All colour combinations were checked with webaim contrast checker to ensure readability.<br>

Teal is used for buttons to stand out whilst fitting the colour scheme. The hover for buttons is set to a darker teal to show they are highlighted.

#2C3E50 - dark blue
#F0F8FF - pale blue
#20B2AA - teal
#008B8B - darker teal

### Fonts

This website uses Inter for the headings and PT Sans for the body text. These were chosen for their readability and style. They are listed as "calm" and "business" on google fonts, which is appropriate for a safeguarding website that aims to be easy to read and approachable, but also professional. They pair well as both are modern sans-serif fonts. I found this combination on fontpair.co.
