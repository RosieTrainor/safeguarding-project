### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen to be calming and professional, whilst meeting accessibility guidelines for colour contrast. A pale blue is used for the background whilst a darker blue is used for the text, navigation and footer. When necessary for accessibilty and colour contract, black or white text is used. <br>

Coral is used for buttons in order to stand out against the blue but not be too jarring or threatening. Teal is used when the buttons are hovered over to highlight this action whilst fitting with the colour scheme. 



#1D3557 - Dark Blue <br>
#E6F2FA - Pale Blue <br>
<!-- #A8B6C1 - for icons -->
#F76C5 - Coral <br>
#006161 - Teal <br>

### Fonts
This website uses Inter for the headings and PT Sans for the body text. These were chosen for their readability and style. They are listed as "calm" and "business" on google fonts, which is appropriate for a safeguarding website that aims to be easy to read and approachable, but also professional. They pair well as both are modern sans-serif fonts.
